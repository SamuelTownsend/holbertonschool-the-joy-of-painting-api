Writeups of the design

What is it your are going to build and how does it fit the theme?
 - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), which is the process of taking data from multiple unique sources, modifying them in some way, and then storing them in a centralized database. This fits the theme because it allows us to take data from "OUTSIDE" sources and organize it in a way it can be useful. 

What tools will you use?
 - PYTHON, SQL, POSTMAN, UML 

How long do you expect to spend on development of each part?
etc.
- Development was expected to take about 1 week.
